# Styling

- We are doing mobile first.
- We are following the 4 point grid (same concept as 8 pt, just allowing for smaller spacings).
- We use CSS variables (custom properties), not SASS/SCSS variables.
- You need to use CSS variables for things like color, border radius and more. Check the `_variables.scss` file to see what is available.
- We use `em` where we can, `px` as a backup or where `em` is not applicable.
- We don't nest our SCSS too deep. Try to keep to a maximum of 3 levels.
- We put media queries into the CSS class itself. We don't wrap multiple classes in a media query.
- We never use global styles.
- We normally use `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated` which scopes the styles to the component.
  If you need to style Angular Material components you can use `ViewEncapsulation.NONE`, but then you need to prefix all your classes with the component selector.

**Break points**

- 360px (small mobile)
- 480px (normal mobile)
- 760px (large mobile / small tablet)
- 1024px (normal tablet)

      <strong>8 point grid</strong>
      Helps designers lay out UI quickly and consistently. Particularly helpful for mobile app UI where there are fixed constraints, useful for
      responsive web design as well.
