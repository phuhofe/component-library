# Atomic design

We recommend reading this article [**atomic web design**](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) by Brad Frost.
If you have the time you should read his book on the topic.

If you don't have time, here is a **super quick and breif overview**:

Atomic design is methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design:

1. Atoms
1. Molecules
1. Organisms
1. Templates
1. Pages

When it comes to organizing things in Storybook we only really care about the first 3, as the individual applications themselfs
should handle 4 and 5. However, it is possible to do 4 and 5 in Storybook if needed.
