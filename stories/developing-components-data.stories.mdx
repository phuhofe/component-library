# Data

**NEVER** USE PRODUCTION DATA.

We use Faker.js to generate fake/mock data to use in our stories: https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker

Have a look at the story for the "Organisms / Search result" component to see an example usage of this.

TODO: Move to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker as the original package is no longer maintained.
