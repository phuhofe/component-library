# Getting started

## Using the components in you project

The UI component library is available as an NPM package on
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/adstate_as/adstate-design-system/component-library/-/packages/2687563).

1. $ `echo @adstate_as:registry=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/npm/ >> .npmrc`
2. $ `npm install @adstate_as/flora --save`

**Example usage:**

example.module.ts:

```ts
import { SearchModule } from '@adstate_as/flora';

@NgModule({
  imports: [SearchModule],
})
export class ExampleModule {}
```

example.component.html:

```html
<flora-search></flora-search>
```

Remember to have Angular Materials and Material Icons installed and available in your project.

## How to use components in an app while still in development

Sometimes we need to work on application code and the UI component library at the same time. We can use `npm link` to link the UI component
library with other project.

Package linking is a two-step process:

**In the UI component library**

- `npm run pack`
- `cd pack`
- `npm link`

**In the app**

- `npm run link-ui`

When this has been setup you can edit, transpile, run tests, or commit as usual in the component library.
While you app runs with the changes you made right away. The symbolic links are local and will not be committed to git.

When you want to go back to using a remote version, just run

- `npm run unlink-ui`
